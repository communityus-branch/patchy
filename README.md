# Patchy: Prototype Visual Scripting Tools for High Fidelity.

Very WIP, does not even work at the moment

## Goals

* Node based data flow interface similar to [Crytek Flowgraph](http://docs.cryengine.com/display/SDKDOC2/Flow+Graph+Editor) or [Unreal Kismet](https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/KismetHome.html).
* Nodes are placed in the world with hand controllers.
* Nodes can be manipulated in the world with hand controllers.
* Links between nodes can be made with hand controllers.
* Entire system is implemented in JavaScript.
* Only minimal set of nodes will be implemented for prototype.
* **STRETCH** nodes are visible to others in the environment
* **STRETCH** nodes/patches change color dynamically based on input.

## Non Goals

* Making it anything other then a prototype
* True multi user support, or any persistence model.
